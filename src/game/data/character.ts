/**
 * On-screen size of each character, relative to the art's native size.
 * The art was drawn at roughly two-thirds of a tile tall, which made Ellen
 * about as tall as the market stall's table; at these sizes she stands a
 * little under a tile, the table reaches her hip, and everyone else sits in
 * proportion to her — Scott a head taller, Scout a medium dog, the cat and
 * fox small.
 *
 * Heights follow the real pair: Ellen is 5'3" and Scott 6'3", so crown to
 * sole he stands 75/63 ≈ 1.19 times her height. His art is 0.682 of a
 * native tile from sole to crown against her 0.65 (hat aside), which puts
 * his scale at 1.4 × 1.19 × 0.65 / 0.682 ≈ 1.59.
